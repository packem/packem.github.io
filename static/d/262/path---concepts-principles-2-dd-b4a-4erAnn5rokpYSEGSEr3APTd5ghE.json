While the exact roadmap isn't shared publicly (we tried it and it turned out to be more distracting than helpful), the things being worked on are generally very visible <a href=\"https://github.com/tryghost/ghost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Currently our primary focus areas largely surround:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making Ghost more flexible and easy to integrate with other apps &#x26; services</li>\n<li>Creating new, sustainable business models for publishers</li>\n<li>Refining and improving the core functionality of the product</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"feature-requests\"><a href=\"#feature-requests\" aria-label=\"feature requests permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Feature requests</h2>\n<p>We welcome feature requests from users over in <a href=\"https://forum.ghost.org/c/Ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the ideas category</a> of the Ghost Forum. Here people can request and suggest things which they'd like to see in Ghost, and others can add their vote or comment. </p>\n<p>The ideas board is a great way for us to gauge user demand, but it's not a democratic system. We don't automatically build things just because they get a lot of votes, and not everything that gets requested makes it into core.</p>\n<p>The best way to get a feature you want looked at quicker is to <a href=\"/concepts/contributing/\">get involved by contributing to the project</a> to help build it.
